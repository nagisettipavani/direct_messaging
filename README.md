# Project description: 
In this Project, a microservice is created for private Direct Messaging between users as like in Twitter. This microservice is written as a separate Flask application connected to an instance of Amazon's DynamoDB Local.

The following are the steps to run the project:
1. Clone the github repository https://github.com/nagisettipavani/direct_messaging

2. Install the pip package manager by running the following commands:

    > sudo apt update
    
    > sudo apt install --yes python3-pip
   
3. Install Flask by:
    
    > python3 -m pip install Flask python-dotenv
   
4. Run the following commands to install Foreman and HTTPie:

    > sudo apt update
    
    > sudo apt install --yes ruby-foreman httpie
    
5. Install Amazon's DynamoDB using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html
    When you reach Step 4, you will not be able to run aws configure until you have installed the AWS CLI. You can use the following commands:

    > sudo apt update
    
    > sudo apt install --yes awscli
    
    For configuring AWS CLI you can use the below command:
    
     > $ aws configure
     > AWS Access Key ID [None]: fakeMyKeyId (sample)
     > AWS Secret Access Key [None]: fakeSecretAccessKey (sample)
     > Default region name [None]: us-west-2 (sample)
     > Default output format [None]: table
 
6.  Install Boto3

     > sudo apt install --yes python3-boto3

6. Then cd into the directMessaging folder in another terminal(other than the dynamodb one)
    Run the following commands:
    
    > flask init (This command should also be run in gateway folder if users or timelines microservice is being used to connect to schema.db
    
    > foreman start -m gateway=1,app=3,timelines=3,directMessaging=3 (Starting an instance of gateway and 3 instances each of timelines and app)
